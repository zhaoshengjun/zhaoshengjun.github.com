I've been through a lot of things. 

I worked as a consultant first in China Mainland for a startup company which focus on providing solutions of HR and ERP. 

Then I got an opportunity to learn SAP HCM and soon I worked as an SAP HCM consultant. But I also did some development work since I have the technical background.

In 2012, my whole family has moved to Australia and I got a job to work for Queensland government. I worked there ever since as a developer.

I've written and published a book - <a href="#" class="btn btn-info">From Beginner To Expert: SAP HCM</a> - which is based on my years of experience.

I am currently exploering other technologies besides SAP ABAP.
